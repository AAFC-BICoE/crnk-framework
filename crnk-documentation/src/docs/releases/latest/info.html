<h4>Misc Improvements</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Support for JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY and JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL on relationships.</li>
	<li>Support for java.util.Optional based on built-in Jackson support. For more information how to setup Jackson, see
		https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-optional.
	</li>
	<li><code>UrlBuilder</code> is available from CrnkBoot and, in case of Spring, as bean for injection.
		It allows the easy construction (and manipulation) of URLs.
	</li>
	<li>
		CrnkCoreAutoConfiguration has been refined to make it more robust against cyclic dependencies between repositories, <code>CrnkBoot</code> and other
		components. This avoids some situations where Spring either fails or partially loads the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		The Typescript generation has been simplified to not have a dependency to the (deprecated) Crnk NPM library. This has already be in place for
		our plain JSON format. Now the same approach is taken for the regular JSON:API format. A dependency to <code>ngrx-json-api</code> still remains
		that in the future may also become optional.
	</li>
</ul>
