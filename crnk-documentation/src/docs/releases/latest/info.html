<h4>Misc Improvements</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Support for JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY and JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL on relationships.</li>
	<li>Support for java.util.Optional based on built-in Jackson support. For more information how to setup Jackson, see
		https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-optional.
	</li>
	<li><code>UrlBuilder</code> is available from CrnkBoot and, in case of Spring, as bean for injection.
		It allows the easy construction (and manipulation) of URLs.
	</li>
	<li>
		CrnkCoreAutoConfiguration has been refined to make it more robust against cyclic dependencies between repositories, <code>CrnkBoot</code> and other
		components. This avoids some situations where Spring either fails or partially loads the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		The Typescript generation has been simplified to not have a dependency to the (deprecated) Crnk NPM library. This has already be in place for
		our plain JSON format. Now the same approach is taken for the regular JSON:API format. A dependency to <code>ngrx-json-api</code> still remains
		that in the future may also become optional.
	<li>The JPA module has updated its sorting behavior to according to
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8139437/how-to-set-the-column-order-of-a-composite-primary-key-using-jpa-hibernate
		where Hibernate does sort columns alphabetically rather than by file/line order. Most notable use case are entities
		with multiple attributes as primary key with paging and no or non-unique sort order. Then crnk already automatically adds
		the primary key to make sure the order is total. This change ensures to hit the index as generated by Hibernate.
		But the behavior can also be disabled. More details <a href="https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/issues/746">here</a>.
	</li>
